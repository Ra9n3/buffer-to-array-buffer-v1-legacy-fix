# Alloy — data model

**Status: Task 3.1 (state foundation). Describes what is in the code, not
what is planned.** Source of truth: `src/lib/project/model.ts` (shapes),
`src/lib/project/session.ts` (the approved fixture session as a project),
`src/lib/project/store.svelte.ts` (the one authoritative store). Where this
document and the code disagree, the code is right and this document is
stale — say so in the next task report.

Everything here is **project data as the approved UI edits it**. There is no
audio, no DSP, no routing graph, no persistence, no undo. Those arrive with
their own tasks (plan §14, Phase 3: routing 3.2; undo / autosave 3.3; the
engine later) and will extend these shapes rather than replace them.

## 1. Identity and references

Every entity has a **stable, kind-prefixed id**. Ids are the only thing
anything is allowed to reference; array positions and display names are
never references (plan §5, owner 2026-11-02).

| Type | Shape | Fixture examples | Constructor / guard |
|------|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| `TrackId` | `` `track-${string}` `` | `track-01` … `track-20` | `trackId(code)` / `isTrackId(id)` |
| `ReturnBusId` | `` `return-${string}` `` | `return-room`, `return-plate`, `return-delay1` | `returnBusId(key)` / `isReturnBusId(id)` |
| `BusId` | `` `bus-${string}` `` | `bus-B1` | `busId(code)` / `isBusId(id)` |
| `ChannelId` | union of the three | — | `project.channel(id)` dispatches on the prefix |

The **printed codes** the hardware shows (`01`, `R1`, `B1`) stay display
fields (`code`) on the entity — they are what the scribble strips print,
never what the model looks up by.

`OutputRef = BusId | "master"` is a routing **destination reference**
(`MASTER_OUTPUT = "master"`). Resolving it to a name is `outputLabel(ref,
buses)` (model) or `project.outputLabel(ref)` (store). Whether a destination
is *allowed* (no cycles, groups ≠ buses — plan §5) is Task 3.2; in 3.1 the
references are data only and no UI edits them.

A **send** references a Return by id: `SendSlot { to: ReturnBusId | null;
level: number }`. Four fixed slots per track (D2.2.9), `to: null` = the
slot is unassigned, level at `SEND_RANGE.min` (OFF).

## 2. Entities

### 2.1 `Track`

| Field | Type | Meaning / origin |
|-------|------|------------------|
| `kind` | `"track"` | discriminant of the `Channel` union |
| `id` | `TrackId` | stable id |
| `code` | `string` | printed two-digit code (`01`) |
| `type` | `"TRK"` | the strip's type print |
| `name` | `string` | the scribble-strip name |
| `org` | `OrgSwatch` | organisational colour (a flat tab, D2.2.13) |
| `familyId` | `FamilyId \| null` | instrument family (Task 2.5 classification) |
| `sourceTypeId` | `string \| null` | source type inside the family (`null` = Unspecified); **must belong to the family** |
| `role` | `RoleId` | plan §5a Role — independent of the tier |
| `priority` | `number` 1–10 | plan §5 Priority — **the stored value**; the Prominence Tier is derived (see §3) |
| `tierConfirmed` | `boolean` | the "needs confirming" lamp (Task 2.5); any tier choice confirms |
| `output` | `OutputRef` | routing destination reference (fixture: every track → `bus-B1`) |
| `channel` | `TrackChannel` | the Console strip's settings: `trim`, `pan`, `level`, `mute`, `solo`, `sends: SendSlot[4]` |
| `loadedSendLevels` | `Partial<Record<ReturnBusId, number>>` | the levels the session loaded with — the ghost print behind the send knobs (D2.2.12) |
| `chain` | `ChainState` | the Task 2.8 processing chain: EQ, dynamic band, compressor, cleanup — each parameter `{ spec, value, original, mode: "auto" \| "manual" }` |
| `display` | `ChannelDisplay` | fixture-backed display facts (`peak` lamp) that must remain until an engine exists |

### 2.2 `ReturnBus` (plan §8a)

`kind: "return"`, `id`, `code` (`R1`), `type: "RET"`, `name`, `short` (the
send-menu print), `org`, `effect: ReturnEffect` (reverb / delay), `channel:
ReturnChannel { level, mute, solo }` (the strip), `chain: ReturnChainState`
(the Task 2.9 effect module: `character`, `time`, `second`, `tone`,
`bypassed`, `notes`), `output: OutputRef` (fixture: Master), `display`.

The chain **no longer carries identity** — in 2.9 `return-chain.svelte.ts`
kept `returnId` / `name` on the chain and a module-level `Map`; in 3.1 the
chain is a pure value under the entity and `return-chain.ts` has no state.

### 2.3 `Bus` (plan §5, §8)

`kind: "bus"`, `id`, `code` (`B1`), `type: "BUS"`, `name`, `org`, `channel:
BusChannel { trim, balance, level, mute, solo }`, `chain: BusChainState`
(reused EQ + compressor + `peakProtection` status, Task 2.9), `output:
OutputRef` (fixture: Master), `display`.

### 2.4 `Channel`, `Arrangement`, `Project`

```ts
type Channel = Track | ReturnBus | Bus;

interface Arrangement {           // the Arrange room's fixture-backed display data (Task 2.6)
  barCount; timeSignature; sections; tempoMarkers;
  clips: Partial<Record<TrackId, readonly ArrangeClip[]>>;   // keyed by id, not row
}

interface Project {
  id; name;
  tracks: Track[]; returns: ReturnBus[]; buses: Bus[];
  arrangement: Arrangement;
}
```

Array order **is** the approved display order (Console left→right, Arrange
top→bottom, Mixer channel order tracks · Returns · buses) but is never used
as an identity.

---

## 3. Priority and the Prominence Tier (D3.1.2)

`priority` (1–10, plan §5) is stored. The tier is **read** from it:

| Tier | Priority band | Anchor when the tier is *chosen* |
|------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Primary | 8–10 | 9 |
| Supporting | 4–7 | 5 |
| Background | 1–3 | 2 |

`tierOfPriority(p)`, `TIER_FLOOR`, `TIER_ANCHOR`, `clampPriority(p)` live in
the model. Choosing a tier (Arrange row or Mixer identity, through
`ops.chooseTrackTier`) moves the priority to the anchor **only if the tier
changes**, and marks the track confirmed. `ops.setTrackPriority` exists for
the numeric override the plan describes; no UI uses it yet. The anchors are
a 3.1 choice the owner may change; nothing else depends on the exact
numbers. The fixture session seeds each track with its fixture tier's
anchor.

---

## 4. The store (`src/lib/project/store.svelte.ts`)

One module-level `$state` tree: `const state: Project =
$state(createSessionProject())`. It is the only project state in `src/`.

**Reads — `project`:** `id`, `name`, `tracks`, `returns`, `buses`,
`arrangement`, `channels` (Mixer order), `track(id)`, `returnBus(id)`,
`bus(id)`, `channel(id)`, `tierOf(track)`, `sendsInto(returnId)` (the live
list of tracks sending to a Return, with the slot level), `sendReturns`
(the send menu's options), `outputLabel(ref)`.

**Writes — `ops`** (one per editable control the approved UI has; all
validate, clamp to the control's range and skip same-value writes; unknown
ids throw):

| Track | Return | Bus |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `setTrackTrim/Pan/Level/Mute/Solo` | `setReturnLevel/Mute/Solo` | `setBusTrim/Balance/Level/Mute/Solo` |
| `setSendTo(id, slot, ReturnBusId \| null)`, `setSendLevel(id, slot, v)` | `setReturnBypass` | |
| `setTrackFamily` (clears a source that no longer belongs), `setTrackSourceType` (must belong) | | |
| `chooseTrackTier`, `setTrackPriority` | | |

The Return's effect-module parameters and the chains' Auto / Manual
ownership are edited through the Task 2.8 helpers (`setParamValue`,
`setMode`, `setAllModes`, `setCharacter`) on the entity's chain objects —
those are already narrow, typed and shared, so 3.1 did not wrap them.

**Views** (memoised per id in `Map`s; getter objects **over** the entity —
derived, never a copy):

| View | Returns | Bound by |
|------|---------|----------|
| `trackStrip(id)` | `TrackStripLive` — identity, channel settings, send-slot views, `returns`, `loadedSendLevels` | `TrackStrip` (Console bank, Mixer track channel) |
| `trackMeta(id)` | `TrackMetaLive` — `familyId`, `sourceTypeId`, `tier` (get = reading, set = choose), `tierConfirmed` | `ArrangeTrackRow`, `MixerTrackStrip` identity |
| `arrangeTrackOf(id)` | `ArrangeTrack` — the row's identity shape | `ArrangeTrackRow` |
| `returnStripOf(id)` / `returnLive(id)` | the Return strip's identity / `ReturnLive` (effect params with 2.9 ownership rules, bypass, level, mute, solo) | `ReturnStrip` in both rooms |
| `busStripOf(id)` / `busLive(id)` | the bus strip's identity / `BusLive` | `BusMasterStrip` in both rooms |

Writes through a view go through `ops`; a view's send `to` setter refuses a
non-Return id.

**Not in the store:** selection (the Mixer's `selectedId` is room-local
`$state`), scroll, open panels, persistence, undo, routing checks.

---

## 5. The session (`src/lib/project/session.ts`)

`createSessionProject()` builds a fresh `Project` from the approved
fixtures only: `TRACK_STRIPS` (Console) joined to `ARRANGE_TRACKS` by code
(Arrange classification), `RETURN_STRIPS`, `BUS_MASTERS`, the chain
constructors (`createChainState`, `createReturnChainState`,
`createBusChainState`) and the Arrange timeline data. Nothing is invented:
every number is a fixture's. Fixture reading carried over from Task 2.4:
every track's `output` is the one bus master; the bus and the Returns go to
Master.

---

## 6. Binding pattern (components)

Strips and rows take their data through **optional props** and keep working
on plain fixtures (the `#/dev/components` playground): `ReturnStrip`,
`BusMasterStrip` and `ArrangeTrackRow` own a seeded fallback (`own`) behind
`model = live ?? own`; `TrackStrip` binds whatever `track` object it is
given (the store view in the rooms). Editable controls use function
bindings (`bind:value={() => model.x, (v) => (model.x = v)}`), so every
interaction writes to the store when bound. Nothing between a control and
the entity holds a copy.

---

## 7. Deferred (by design)

| Topic | Task |
|-------|------|
| Routing validity, destinations offered, cycle rejection, send modes | 3.2 |
| Undo / redo, autosave, copy / paste | 3.3 |
| Project folder + JSON manifest (plan §11) | with persistence |
| Engine-written values (Auto parameters updating), meters, peak detection | engine tasks |
| Numeric Priority UI, BALANCE / TONE semantics (2.4 open item) | owner decision |
